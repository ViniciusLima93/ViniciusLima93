</h1> I'm Vinicius Lima, a passionate frontend developer on a journey to craft delightful user experiences. My coding playground revolves around React.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, and the art of building beautiful UIs. I have a penchant for creating seamless interfaces with the help of Material UI, and I'm always exploring new ways to enhance user interactions.

Beyond the React ecosystem, I'm expanding my horizons and delving into the realm of Angular, eager to broaden my skill set and embrace diverse perspectives in frontend development.
